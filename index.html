        <p>What? We're not at all alike! Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for
            promotion? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed
            the
            phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named
            "Enterprise." Damage report! My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you
            obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? You bet I'm agitated! I may be
            surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane.
